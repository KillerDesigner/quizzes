#     
# This is our first week's quiz! Let's find out what we know.
# 

# The ideal range of your motor cycle speed 20 - 55. Over 55 is SCAREE!
# Check if your moto_speed is within that range using boolean (&&, ||)
# operators and comparison operators (== =< >= !=)

moto_speed = ?

# if your moto_speed variable is in the right range print out a good
# message, aka "Wheee!" Otherwise print out an appropriate response.
# Your code goes below:



# Make a method to start your bike! It should print out "vrooom!"
# when it's called

def make_vroom
  
end

# You're the leader of the pack. 
# Create an Array of motorcycle makes!

my_convoy = []

# Loop through your convoy and print out each motorcycle's make
# Your code below:



# You need to keep track of your gang. 
# Create a Hash containing riders' info.

my_gang = {}

# Loop through your gang and print out each rider's name
# Your code below:


# Define an Class to represent each gang member 
# It should include methods to set their name and motorcyle make
# Give it some useful methods! For example, when say_name(rider) 
# is called the rider's name is printed out

Class Rider
  def initialize(name, moto_model)
  end

  def say_name(rider)
  end
end

# Create a Hash of Rider objects! Then loop through the Hash
# and call the say_name of each rider.
# Your code below:
