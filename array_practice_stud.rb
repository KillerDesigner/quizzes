# create an Array of 4 shoes


# iterate through your Array using each and {}'s
# and show a list of your shoes


# create an Array of 4 outfits using Array.new



# iterate through your outfits using a Range and do\end
# and print them out


# Shuffle each Array



# iterate through your Arrays and puts each outfit with each shoes
# using any form of iteration that floats your boat!



# A friend needs the perfect shoes, give her the last pair



# now you need a new pair, so push one in



# each outfit now needs to have "super duper" added to the front of it
# use a map to do this & make sure it stays that way



# each pair of shoes now needs a "!" after it
# do this using a map, but don't change the original Array



# Shuffle each Array again then print out a new 
# set of outfits + shoes, mapping a "!" on the end of each
